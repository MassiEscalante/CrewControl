# CrewControl 🖨️ 

## Motivation 📈 

My motivation for building this project was to create a command-line tool that brings efficiency and organization to employee management and explore how to interact with databases and improve my skills with SQL, Node.js, and Inquirer.js.

## Why Build This Project? 🗂️ 

I built **CrewControl** to provide a streamlined way for businesses to manage their departments, roles, and employees directly from the command line. 🏢

## Problem It Solves 🕵️‍♀️ 

**CrewControl** offers a simple interface for viewing, adding, and updating employees, roles, and departments without the need for a complex UI. 📎 

## What I Learned ✏️ 

How to interact with a PostgreSQL database using SQL queries, work with user input using Inquirer.js, and manage data relationships between tables (Employees and roles).

## What Makes It Stand Out 💬 

**CrewControl** is a simple CLI tool that helps businesses keep their employee data organized in an easy-to-use format. It brings functionality to the terminal and makes managing data straightforward and efficient. 🔑
